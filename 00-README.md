wxPythonDemos
=============

wxPython Demos: Various small demos of wxPython features -- developed over years of discussion on the wxPython-users mailinglist.

This is a collection of a bunch of mini apps, each designed to test one
small piece of wxPython.

Some of these were done in response to things I was trying to figure out
myself, and some to help answer a question on the wxPython-users list. 

Some of the code I wrote myself, and some was written by other folks on
the list, and edited by me.

Note that these were written over a long period of time, with a lot of
wxPython versions. They may not all run under the latest version, and
some of them are written in very outdated style.

Please don't imitate all the style you see here. For a description of
good, modern pythonic style, see:

http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/wxPython_Style_Guide

Despite these flaws, I think there is a lot to be learned from this
collection.

I suggest you search or grep for a widget you may want to learn somethign about, or just fire up each one and see what it does!

To Do
----------

One of these days, I'd like to go through the code and clean it all up -- proper modern style, testing on recent wxPyton versions and all OSs, etc.

It would also be great to put in more documentation -- maybe a Sphinx auto-generated doc.
